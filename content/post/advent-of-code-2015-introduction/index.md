So, what is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual set of coding exercises built around a Christmas-themed narrative. There are two sequenced problems per day, with the second problem usually building on the first in complexity. As the story proceeds, the problems get progressively more difficult, requiring deeper consideration of algorithms and data structures in order to solve the problems correctly and in a reasonable time frame. 

Naturally, this gives us a lot of opportunities to discuss data structures, algorithms, and the relative strengths and weaknesses of different programming languages for performing different tasks.

In this series of articles, I will be implementing a solution for each problem in the Advent of Code 2015 series in C, and then in Python, Go, and Rust. I'm using C as a baseline due to it's relatively low-level nature; many of the necessary data structures will require either implementing or evaluating and choosing an external library to use. It is also both simple and complex as a language, with minimal syntax, but also requiring explicit management of memory.

My hope is that these articles both help me improve my effectiveness as a technical writer, and teach coders at multiple levels something new, or at least a different perspective on a problem.

I'll keep this post up to date with links to the articles in this series, so you can bookmark this page as an index of sorts.
