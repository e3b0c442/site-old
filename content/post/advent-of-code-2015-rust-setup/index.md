Let's get our repo set up for the Rust side of our project.

The astute reader may have noticed that I've titled this post "setup" and not "boilerplate". This is because our setup will obviate the need for boilerplate! Honestly it's quite similar to the code generation setup Go uses, except it's using a Rust _build script_, which does not place the generated source in the repo like our Go generator does.

## Cargo

`cargo` is Rust's first-class build and dependency manager. One _can_ run the Rust compiler individually, but it generally doesn't make sense to. The first thing we are going to do is run `cargo new aoc2015` to make our package. This creates a simple hello world application with the necessary files. In particular, we're interested in `Cargo.toml`. Here's what the generated file looks like:

```toml
[package]
name = "aoc2015"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
```

This file includes our package metadata and list of dependencies. While Rust does have a good standard library, it does not cover as much functionality as the Go standard library so we will need to use some external dependencies. We are going to immediately add to this file to include a few dependencies (which we'll cover in a bit):

```toml
[package]
name = "aoc2015"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
simple-error = "0.2"

[build-dependencies]
tinytemplate = "1"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
```

We've added `simple-error"`to our dependencies, and also added a new `build-dependencies` section with `tinytemplate` and `serde`. For the former two, we've used a simplified value which is just a version number. This behaves as a `*.x`, so for `simple-error` the latest `0.2.x` version will be retrieved, for tinytemplate the latest `1.x` version. This allows you to pin to the extent you feel is appropriate.

We'll discuss what each of these dependencies is for as we encounter them.

## src/main.rs

The other file generated by `cargo new` is `src/main.rs`. This is exactly what you think it might be: the entrypoint for the program.
