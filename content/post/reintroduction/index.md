So, I've decided to give this blogging thing another try.

If you're one of the lucky few on the Internet reading this, what can you expect?

The answer is, mostly technical discussion. I might make a post here and there about how the [Minnesota Wild](https://wild.com) are doing, or about [Eric Whitacre's latest project](https://www.bluetoad.com/publication/?m=63825&i=729173&p=6&ver=html5), but mostly, you can expect me to talk about the things I'm building, the things I'm learning, and the projects I'm taking on.

While I hope you, the gentle reader, get something out of what you're reading, these posts are really for me to practice technical writing and how to teach a concept.

If you have feedback for me, I'd love to hear it. Fill out the [contact form](/about#contact) and let me know what you think. This is a growth exercise for me, and growth requires feedback and critique.

With that, my plan is to make an(other) attempt at walking through Advent of Code exercises. This time, I'll be doing each exercise in C as a baseline, and then in Go, Python, and Rust, discussing data structures, algorithms, and advantages of disadvantages for the different languages for each exercise.

Along the way, there will be various scattered posts about Go, Kubernetes, and other technologies that interest me.

Thanks for coming along for the ride.
